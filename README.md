Make School Web 1.0: Tip Calculator with JavaScript

This project is a simple tip calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user enters the subtotal, tip percentage, and number of people splitting the bill, and the site immediately provides the correct values for the dollar amount of tip each person should pay as well and the final bill total (including tip).
